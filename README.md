# google-homepage

First project from TOP. Will rebuild the homepage from google using HTML and CSS. At first, there is no need to add advanced properties, like hover, drop-down menus, etc..

First thoughts: 
    Maybe it looks simple to you, but it is exciting for me. Probably I'm going to tackle the difficult task too.
